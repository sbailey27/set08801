                <p>Follow these EXACTLY or I'm calling the police:</p>
                <li>Skillet. High heat. Lil bit of oil. In goes the meat. Sear that
                    meat like it insulted your mother.
                </li>
                <li>Scorch that meat till it's cooked thoroughly. Then toss in the 
                    salt and spices to taste.
                </li>
                <li>Reduce heat and empty that jar of pasta sauce into the meat. Mix it all around 
                    and let it cook for a few minutes to thicken up.
                </li>
                <li>When that's done, IT"S LAYERING TIME!!!</li>
                <li>LISTEN CLOSELY: meat sauce. sheet. cheese. repeat. Got it?
                    meat sauce. sheet, cheese repeat. 
                </li>
                <li>Bake for 40 minutes covered in foil. Remove foil for the last 
                    10 minutes of baking for that cheesy crust </li>
